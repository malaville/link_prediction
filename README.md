This repository is aimed at doing link prediction in investors-startup bipartite graph.

■ [Preparing Real Data](https://github.com/malaville/link_prediction/blob/master/preparing_real_data.ipynb) prepares the data and puts it in a **utils.p** file that can be used to work.

■ [Generate Dataframes and Predict](https://github.com/malaville/link_prediction/blob/master/generate-dataframes-and-predict.ipynb) shows how with prepared data, we generate dataframes and begin to predict and compare predictions



The paper I inspire of is [Zheng's](https://github.com/malaville/link_prediction/blob/master/base_papers/zheng.pdg) which you can find in /base_papers
